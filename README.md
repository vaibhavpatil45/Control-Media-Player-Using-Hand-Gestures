# Control-Media-Player-Using-Hand-Gestures
The Main aim of this application is to use the most natural form i.e., Hand gestures to interact with the computer system. 
These gestures are implemented in such a way that they are easy to perform, fast, efficient and ensuring an immediate response.
The application uses your device's camera to give you touch-free and remote-free control over your media player application (without any special hardware).
It increases productivity and makes life easier and comfortable by letting you control your device from a distance. 
By reading the requirements.txt install the required libraries n using this command "streamlit run localapp.py" run the project.
